          em a
          |) color values, comma separated. Clic 'Convert!'.
        p Done.

          em stylesheet-ready

        hr
        p Don't paste in special characters, hieroglyphics, plans for building a rocket, or a greasy piece of your lunch.
        p 
          strong Just hex colors
          |, 
          strong comma separated
          |.
        p It accepts lower case and upper case, and you can even leave a space after the comma. Or three.
        p It also accepts a single line list, as well as values in multiple lines. You can omit the # if you'd like.
        p And it also accepts hex color values with an alpha channel (#RRGGBBAA or #RGBA, 8 or 4 character hex codes). It will convert them to hsla.

        p This would work too:

        p This too:
        pre #FfF, #F34, CE8,#Fb5, #429, #dE1,#C6E, 44D,   #82B,
        p Even this would work (try it above):
